Updates for 3-21-2024:
	After you guys left I figured out Matteo was right the .hex file was in decimal and wasn't responding
	to the "$readmemh" obv, I tried "$readmemd" which compiled but the model sim didn't recognize the function
	I reverted to "$readmemh" and created a new file called testHEXdata.hex. (for some reason won't open
	in Quartis must be opened separately in Notepad) where I input some test values. It works and stores all 
	values in the array. I have them in two hex digits but you can change it to 8. I tested different
	values and it still worked.

Updates for 3-25-2024:	
	Worked On the Ram, Changed the testbench to be able to change the address, address needed to be 8'b instead
	Of hex in new file. Added some print statements for when you run the model sim. The Wren signal will act properly
	in test bench but will not be propogated properly to the ram module, tried a few things but couldnt get it to work.
	If the signal propogates everything should be set up to allow to read and write to RAM memory
