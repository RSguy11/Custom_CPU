Updates for 3-21-2024:

	After you guys left figure out matteo was right the .hex file was in decimal and wasnt responding
	to the readmemh obv, I tried readmemd which compiled but the model sim didnt reonize the function
	I reverted back to readmemh and created a new file called testHEXdata.hex. (for some reason wont open
	in quartis must be opened seperately in notepad) where I input some test values. It worked and stores all 
	values in the array. I have them in two hex digit but pretty sure you can change it to 8. Tested different
	values and it still worked.
