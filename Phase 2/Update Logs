Updates for 3-21-2024:

	After you guys left I figured out Matteo was right the .hex file was in decimal and wasn't responding
	to the "$readmemh" obv, I tried "$readmemd" which compiled but the model sim didn't recognize the function
	I reverted to "$readmemh" and created a new file called testHEXdata.hex. (for some reason won't open
	in Quartis must be opened separately in Notepad) where I input some test values. It works and stores all 
	values in the array. I have them in two hex digits but you can change it to 8. I tested different
	values and it still worked.
